## Hello, world

I'm Karun, and I'm excited to welcome you to my blog. I'm currently studying
network technology at the [HTL Rennweg](https://htl.rennweg.at/) in Vienna,
Austria.

I'm quite passionate about technology, especially Linux and programming.
Furthermore, I've been using **Linux** and programming in **Python** since 2020.
As expected, I've learned a lot during this time, and I'm excited to share
some of my experiences and thoughts with you. After starting at HTL Rennweg, I
learned **Java**, **networking**, and many other things.

So, what can you expect from this blog? I'll be writing about programming,
Linux, and technology in general. It will be a mix of tutorials, guides, and
personal experiences. Hopefully, there's something for everyone, whether you're
a beginner or an expert.

For any questions you can reach me on
[Discord](https://discord.com/users/598851082902306826),

the post use the Comments at the bottom (beware you will need a GitHub account
for that).
