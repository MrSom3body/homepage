## homepage

This project is the current website you're on. It started off as a school
project in the subject media technology to test out [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/),
but it turned out so good that I just kept using it as my actual homepage.

## DiagNet

[DiagNet](https://diagnet.dev) is my diploma thesis project that brings a
Test-Driven Development (TDD)-inspired workflow to network engineering. It
enables engineers to define, execute, and compare automated network tests,
making it easier to validate configurations, detect issues, and ensure
consistent results.

## TuxShare

TuxShare is an AirDrop-style file sharing tool for Linux and Windows, written
in Dart. It provides a clean shell interface for quick, local transfers between
devices on the same network. Designed to be private, cross-platform, and easy to
use, TuxShare avoids cloud dependencies while focusing on speed and simplicity.

## gotcha

`gotcha` is a quick little fetch written in go. The main purpose was to be
faster than my old fetch [macchina](https://github.com/Macchina-CLI/macchina).
Also it is my first _real_ project in go.

## CloudSurge

CloudSurge was developed as a project for school with some friends of mine
to make the installation of a GNS3 server in the cloud easier. It was a great
way to learn some things about different cloud provider, but this project
unfortunately turned out as a real hassle to develop for, so it isn't maintained
anymore.

## dotfiles

These are my [NixOS](https://nixos.org) dotfiles. NixOS is a very different
kind of Linux distribution, but I'm too lazy to write an article about it (yet),
so here's a [quick introduction](https://youtu.be/FJVFXsNzYZQ) by
[Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship).
